# Welcome to react native starter kit ðŸ‘‹

This project is using

- [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app)
- [React native Reusables](https://github.com/mrzachnugent/react-native-reusables) as UI library using [nativewind](https://www.nativewind.dev/)
- [https://supabase.com/](https://supabase.com/) for the database an auth

## screens

the app contains the next screens:

- sign up/log in screen
- profile editing screen
- cards screen
- user profile screen

which all uses expo router and have the minimum running example to start on top of it.

## Setting up:

You need to have a supabase database and update the `.env` with the related links to get the project up.

As for the database you can start with [supabase template](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/tutorials/with-expo-react-native#set-up-the-database-schema), user management script, and run it to work with that.

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
